An Optimize recording session provides you with the query latencies of the executed queries recorded during the session, including average duration, 50th percentile, 99th percentile, and maximal query execution time.

## Total query durations

Prisma Optimize provides the total latency for a query pattern so that you can analyze and debug slow queries.

### Average query duration (**`AVG`**)

The average query duration helps you understand the general performance of your queries by providing the mean execution time. This metric is useful for identifying overall trends and spotting inefficiencies that affect the typical user experience.

### 50th percentile (**`P50`**)

The 50th percentile (median) query duration indicates the time it takes for half of the queries to complete. This metric is useful for understanding the typical performance experienced by users, as it is not skewed by outliers.

### 99th percentile (**`P99`**)

The 99th percentile query duration shows the execution time for the slowest 1% of queries. This metric is critical for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks that affect a small but significant portion of users, ensuring that the worst-case scenarios are optimized.

### Maximal query duration (**`MAX`**)

The maximal query duration provides the execution time of the single slowest query. This metric is useful for pinpointing extreme cases and understanding the worst performance your system can exhibit, helping you to diagnose and fix potential outliers.
