The AI Explainer feature helps you implement a [recommendation](/optimize/recommendation) in your specific context. It allows you to ask follow-up questions for further clarity.

## Using the AI explainer

To interact with the AI Explainer:

1. Select a recommendation from an Optimize [recording](/optimize/recordings).
2. Locate and click the **Ask AI** button.

This will help you understand a recommendation better and see how to apply it using your Prisma model as context.
