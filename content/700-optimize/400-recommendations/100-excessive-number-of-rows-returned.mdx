The following query targeting a `User` model do not provide a [`take` option](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany).

```ts
await user.findMany({ select: { email: "niko@prisma.io", }})
```

## Why is this a problem?

When you execute a query without specifying a limit, the query will return all relevant rows. This can be undesirable for several reasons:

### User experience

- **Viewing data:** Users typically need only a portion of the data at any given time, rather than all the data at once
- **Impact on the user's device:** Displaying all the data at once can burden the user's device resources. For example, loading thousands of rows of data in a web application can cause the browser to become slow or unresponsive, consuming a significant amount of the user's device memory and CPU to display this data
- **Waiting time:** Retrieving a large number of rows can significantly increase the time it takes get the data from the database to the user's own device.

### Resource Utilization

- **Unnecessary data load:** The application processes more data than required, wasting processing resources.
- **Memory usage:** Higher memory consumption leads to inefficient memory use. In severe cases, the system can run out of memory, disrupting the service.

## Recommendation

To avoid these issues, we recommend the [`take` option](/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany) to limit the number of entries returned by your queries:

```typescript
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  take: 10, // Limits the number of results to 10
  // other query parameters
})
```

Before applying this recommendation, it is important to verify that your application does not depend on retrieving all results from the query. If your application requires all results, you may need to implement *pagination*. Learn more about pagination in Prisma: [Pagination Documentation](/orm/prisma-client/queries/pagination)
