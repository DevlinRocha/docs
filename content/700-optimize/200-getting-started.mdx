## Prerequisites

To get started with Optimize, you will need the following:

- A [Prisma Data Platform workspace](https://console.prisma.io).
- A project that uses [Prisma Client](/orm/prisma-client) `5.16.1` or higher (we always recommend using the latest version of Prisma).
- A PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, or MongoDB database.

## 1. Enable Optimize

Login to your [Prisma Data Platform account](https://console.prisma.io) and then navigate to the [ Optimize dashboard](https://optimize.prisma.io).

## 2. Add Optimize to your application

### 2.1. Update your `schema.prisma` file

In your Prisma schema's `generator` block add the `tracing` preview feature:
```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["tracing"]
}
```

Then generate Prisma Client using:
```terminal
npx prisma generate
```

### 2.2. Install the Optimize Prisma Client extension

Install the latest version of Prisma Client and Optimize Prisma Client extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/client@latest @prisma/extension-optimize
```

### 2.3. Extend your Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension

Add the following to extend your existing Prisma Client instance with the Optimize extension:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { withOptimize } from '@prisma/extension-optimize'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withOptimize())
```

### 2.4. Use Prisma Optimize to generate insights

Create a new recording in your Prisma Optimize dashboard to receive insights on your database queries by following these steps:
1. Locate and click the **Start recording** button and then run your app. 
2. Once you see query insights are generated for the desired queries or your app completes execution, locate and click the **Stop recording** button. You can then click on the individual queries to see more details.
3. Navigate to the **Recommendations** tab to see if any improvements have been suggested by Optimize to improve query performance.
