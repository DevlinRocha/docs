The Recordings feature is designed for developers to debug and isolate different sets of queries into distinct sessions, known as recordings. This allows for targeted performance analysis and optimization, ensuring that queries from different applications or testing rounds do not get mixed, leading to clearer insights and more effective debugging.

## Managing a recording session

You can manually start and stop recording sessions via the [Optimize dashboard](https://optimize.prisma.io), by clicking the **Start recording** and **Stop recording** buttons present in the dashboard. 

:::warning

A recording will automatically stop when 10k query limit is reached or if the prisma schema of the app is changed.

:::

A recording session can be deleted when no longer needed.

## Identification of a recording session

You can rename and tag your recording session for easy identification and context. You can do this by clicking on the generated default name of the recording session, and then typing the desired name for your recording session.

## Data captured from a recording session

Each recording session captures insights about queries executed in your app, they include:
    - All executed queries during a recording session.
    - **Raw Query**: the raw query that is generated and sent to the database by Prisma ORM.
    - **Count**: Number of times the query was executed. 
    - Performance metrics 
      - **`AVG`**: The average query latency.
      - **`p50`**: The 50th percentile of the query latency.
      - **`P99`**: The 99th percentile of the query latency.
      - **`MAX`**: The maximum query latency.
    - Errors encountered during query execution

Each recording can have a maximum of 10K queries, however, there are no limits on storage retention period.

## Recommendations generated from a recording session

When a recording session ends, Optimize also recommendations such as:
    - [Queries on unindexed columns](/optimize/recommendations#queries-on-unindexed-columns)
    - [Excessive number of rows returned](/optimize/recommendations#excessive-number-of-rows-returned)
    - [Full table scans caused by LIKE operations](/optimize/recommendations#full-table-scans-caused-by-like-operations)
