Below are the known limitations when using Prisma Optimize. If you are aware of any limitations that are missing, please let us know on the `#help-and-questions` channel in our community [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

## Query limit on a recording session

Each [recording session](/optimize/recordings) can contain a maximum of 10k queries. Once this limit is reached, the recording session will end.

## Recording limit per workspace

Each [workspace](/platform/about#workspace) can contain a maximum of 100 [recordings](/optimize/recordings).

## Scope and constraints for the AI Explainer

While the [AI explainer](/optimize/ai-explainer) can provide helpful guidance to implement a [recommendation](/optimize/recommendations), there are some important limitations to keep in mind:

- **Information and accuracy**: The AI's advice is based on a general knowledge base and does not have direct access to Prisma ORM documentation. This may lead to occasional inaccuracies or outdated information.

- **Limited context and adaptation**: The AI does not persist conversations and does not learn from previous interactions. Its responses are generalized and may not always meet the specific needs of advanced users.

- **Static knowledge and scope**: The AI's knowledge is static and may not include recent updates or best practices after a certain date. It provides advice only within the context of Prisma ORM and cannot modify/execute code or interact directly with user environments.
