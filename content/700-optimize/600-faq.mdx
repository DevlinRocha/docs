## Does Optimize automatically implement optimizations?

Prisma Optimize provides insights and recommendations on how to improve your database queries. It does not alter any existing queries or your Prisma schema.

There are no limits on the storage retention period. Optimize will store a recording session until you explicitly delete it.
