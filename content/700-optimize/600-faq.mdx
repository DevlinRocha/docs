## Does Optimize automatically implement optimizations?

Prisma Optimize provides insights and recommendations on how to improve your database queries. It does not alter any existing queries or your Prisma schema.

## How long is a recording session retained in Optimize?

There are no limits on the storage retention period. Optimize will store a recording session until you explicitly delete it.

## Do recommendation usage limits reset every month?

Yes, the recommendation usage resets at the beginning of each calendar month. For example, if you use 5 recommendations by the end of the month, your usage will reset to 0 at the start of the next month.

## Can I get charged for exceeding the recommendation limit on the starter plan?

Yes, if youâ€™re on the starter plan, exceeding 5 recommendations in a billing cycle will result in a $5 charge at the end of that cycle. For more information, visit [our pricing page](https://www.prisma.io/pricing#optimize).
