This page covers how things you need to know in order to deploy an Edge function to Deno Deploy that uses Prisma Client for talking to a database.

## General considerations when deploying to Deno Deploy

### Using an edge-compatible driver

**Note**: [Prisma Accelerate](/acccelerate) enables you to access _any_ database from _any_ edge function provider. No edge-compatible driver is necessary.

When deploying to Denoy Deploy with Prisma ORM, you need to use an [edge-compatible driver]() and its respective [driver adapter]() for Prisma ORM.

The edge-compatible drivers for Cloudflare Workers are:

- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [PlanetScale Serverless](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) uses Cloudflare's `connect()` (TCP) to access the database

> **Note**: There's [also work being done](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2289) on the `node-mysql2` driver which will enable to access traditional MySQL databases from edge functions as well.

### Setting your database connection URL as an environment variable

First, ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set as the `url` of the `datasource` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // this might also be `mysql` or another value depending on your database
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

#### Development

When in **development**, you can configure your database connection via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (e.g. [using `.env` files](/orm/more/development-environment/environment-variables/env-files)).

#### Production

When deploying your Worker to **production**, you'll need to set the database connection using the `vercel` CLI:

```terminal
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL your-database-connection-string
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```terminal
npx vercel env add DATABASE_URL postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb
```

Alternatively, you can configure environment variables directly in the Vercel Dashboard or your project.
