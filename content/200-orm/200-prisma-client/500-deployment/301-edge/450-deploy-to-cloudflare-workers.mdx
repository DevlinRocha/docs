## General considerations when deploying to Cloudflare Workers

- include note about Accelerate
- set `DATABASE_URL` env var, e.g. via `wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL`

## Database-specific considerations & instructions

### Deploying with a D1 database

### Deploying with a PlanetScale database

- with PlanetScale: manually remove conflicting `cache`field ([context](https://www.notion.so/Prisma-Cloudflare-Workers-and-Pages-107091db465f4ae08606dbf3070a0821?pvs=21))

### Deploying with a Neon database

### Deploying with a traditional PostgreSQL database

- with node-postgres: set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`
