This page covers how the things you need to know in order to deploy an Edge function to Cloudflare Workers that uses Prisma Client for talking to a database.

## General considerations when deploying to Cloudflare Workers

### Using an edge-compatible driver

**Note**: [Prisma Accelerate](/acccelerate) enables you to access _any_ database from _any_ edge function provider. No edge-compatible driver is necessary.

When deploying a Cloudflare Worker that uses Prisma ORM, you need to use an [edge-compatible driver]() and its respective [driver adapter]() for Prisma ORM.

The edge-compatible drivers for Cloudflare Workers are:

- [Neon Serverless](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [PlanetScale Serverless](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-serverless-driver) uses HTTP to access the database
- [`node-postgres`](https://node-postgres.com/) (`pg`) uses Cloudflare's `connect()` (TCP) to access the database

> **Note**: There's [also work being done](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/pull/2289) on the `node-mysql2` driver which will enable to access traditional MySQL databases from edge functions as well.

### Setting your database connection URL as an environment variable

First, ensure that the `DATABASE_URL` is set as the `url` of the `datasource` in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql" // this might also be `mysql` or another value depending on your database
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

#### Development

When using your Worker in **development**, you can configure your database connection via the [`.dev.vars` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-in-development) locally.

Assuming you use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable from above, you can set it inside `.dev.local` as follows:

```bash
# .dev.local
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```bash
# .dev.local
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

#### Production

When deploying your Worker to **production**, you'll need to set the database connection using the `wrangler` CLI:

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL your-database-connection-string
```

In the above snippet, `your-database-connection-string` is a placeholder that you need to replace with the value of your own connection string, for example:

```terminal
npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb
```

## Database-specific examples

This section provides database-specific instructions for deploying a Cloudflare Worker with Prisma ORM.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite for the following section, you need to have a Cloudflare Worker running locally and the Prisma CLI installed. If you don't have that yet, you can run these commands:

```terminal
npm create cloudflare@latest prisma-cloudflare-worker-example -- --type hello-world
cd prisma-cloudflare-worker-example
npm install prisma --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

We'll use the default `User` model for the example below:

```prisma
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
}
```

### PostgreSQL (traditional)

If you are using a traditional PostgreSQL database that's accessed via TCP, you need to:

- use the `@prisma/adapter-pg` database adapter (via the `driverAdapters` Preview feature)
- set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

The following steps are the instructions to deploy the Cloudflare Worker.

#### 1. Configure Prisma schema & database connection

First, ensure that database connection is configured properly. In your Prisma schema, set the `url` of the `datasource` block to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. You also need to enable the `driverAdapters` feature flag:

```prisma
// schema.prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

Next, you need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the value of your database connection string.

If you ran `npx prisma init`, you can use the `.env` file that was created by this command. Another option is to follow [Cloudflare's documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#secrets-in-development) and create a `.dev.vars` file. The syntax for declaring environment variables is identical in both cases:

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text=".env" icon="file"/>, <FileWithIcon text=".dev.vars" icon="file"/>]}>

<tab>

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

</tab>

<tab>

```bash
# .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin:mypassword42@somehost.aws.com:5432/mydb"
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

#### 2. Install dependencies

Next, install the required packages:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg
npm install pg
npm install @types/pg --save-dev # if you're using TypeScript
```

#### 3. Set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

In your `wranger.toml` file, add the following line:

```toml
node_compat = true
```

#### 4. Migrate your database schema (if applicable)

If you ran `npx prisma init` above, you need to migrate your database schema to create the `User` table that's defined in your Prisma schema (if you already have all the tables you need in your database, you can skip this step):

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

#### 5. Use Prisma Client in your Worker to send a query to the database

Here is a sample code snippet that you can code to instantiate `PrismaClient` and send a query to your database:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client/edge'
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
import { Pool } from 'pg'

export interface Env {
  DATABASE_URL: string
}

export default {
  async fetch(_: any, env: Env) {
    const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })
    const adapter = new PrismaPg(pool)
    const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })

    const users = await prisma.user.findMany()
    const result = JSON.stringify(users)
    return new Response(result)
  },
}
```

#### 6. Run the Worker locally

To run the Worker locally, you can run the `wrangler dev` command:

```terminal
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 1. Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

- with node-postgres: set `node_compat = true` in `wrangler.toml`

### PlanetScale

- with PlanetScale: manually remove conflicting `cache`field ([context](https://www.notion.so/Prisma-Cloudflare-Workers-and-Pages-107091db465f4ae08606dbf3070a0821?pvs=21))
