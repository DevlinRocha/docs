## Getting started with TypedSQL

To start using TypedSQL in your Prisma project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `@prisma/client` and `prisma` installed and updated to at least version 5.18.0.

2. Create a `sql` directory inside your `prisma` directory. This is where you'll write your SQL queries.

3. Write your SQL queries in `.sql` files within the `sql` directory. For example:

   ```sql title="prisma/sql/getUsersWithPosts.sql"
   SELECT u.id, u.name, COUNT(p.id) as postCount
   FROM users u
   LEFT JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.authorId
   GROUP BY u.id, u.name
   ```

4. Run the following command to generate TypeScript functions and types for your SQL queries:

   ```terminal
   prisma generate --sql
   ```

5. Now you can import and use your SQL queries in your TypeScript code:

   ```typescript title="/src/index.ts"
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
   import { getUsersWithPosts } from '@prisma/client/sql'

   const prisma = new PrismaClient()

   async function main() {
     const usersWithPostCounts = await prisma.$queryRawTyped(getUsersWithPosts)
     console.log(usersWithPostCounts)
   }

   main()
     .catch(console.error)
     .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect())
   ```

### Examples

For practical examples of how to use TypedSQL in various scenarios, please refer to the [Prisma Examples repo](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples). This repo contains a collection of ready-to-run Prisma example projects that demonstrate best practices and common use cases, including TypedSQL implementations.
